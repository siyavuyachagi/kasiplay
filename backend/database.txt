PostgreSQL (Recommended)
Why it's faster:

Superior indexing (GiST, GIN, BRIN, partial indexes)
Better concurrent read/write performance
More efficient query planner
Native JSON support (faster than SQL Server's implementation)
Open-source and free (no licensing costs)

EF Core Support:

Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL - rock solid
Full feature parity with SQL Server provider
Easy migration from SQL Server concepts

Learning curve: Minimal! If you know SQL Server, you'll adapt quickly. Syntax is 95% the same.
