My Recommendation
Since you're proficient in both and work primarily with Vue.js/Nuxt.js:

Quick MVPs, real-time apps, or microservices: Node.js + Express
Complex business logic, enterprise apps, or data-heavy applications: C# + EF Core

You could also consider building a C# Web API (ASP.NET Core) for the backend while keeping your Vue.js/Nuxt.js frontend - you get the best of both worlds: strong backend architecture with a modern JavaScript frontend.
